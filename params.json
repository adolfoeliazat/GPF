Historical Gold Prices dataset has been selected from usagold.com website. Seasonal decomposition, exponential model, ARIMA model, and automated forecasting approaches is used to forecast the price of gold as well as many other algorithms in FORECAST package.\r\n\r\nA R Shiny web app to examine all the available forcasting algorithms in FORECAST package.  We used rStudio to build the project and run it.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to run it?\r\n---\r\nafter cloning and installing rstudio with shiny and forecast packages\r\nOpen your rstudio app File tap -> Open Project\r\nNavigate to the cloned folder and select GPF.Rproj\r\nafter that make sure you are on the right working directory \r\nin Files tap on the bottom right window in rstudio you should navigate to the project folder then\r\nhit More -> Set as Working Directory\r\n\r\nnow open ui.R and hit run app or in the console write:\r\nrunApp(\"../GPF\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nGold Price Forecasting | rStudio | shiny","google":"UA-60448534-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
